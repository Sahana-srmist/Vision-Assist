Project Description
Vision Assist is an assistive device designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings. This project utilizes Arduino to process inputs from sensors and provide real-time feedback.

Features
Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection
Audio or vibration feedback for alerts
Lightweight and portable design
Easy-to-use functionality

Project Files
Vision_Assist.ino – Arduino code for the system

Hardware Components
Arduino Uno
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
Buzzer/Vibration Motor
Battery Module

How It Works
The ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles in the user’s path.
The Arduino processes the data and triggers an alert (buzzer/vibration).
The user is informed about the obstacle and can adjust their path.

How to Run the Code
Open Vision_Assist.ino in the Arduino IDE.
Connect the Arduino board to your PC via USB.
Upload the code and test the system.

Future Improvements
Integrate AI-based object recognition
Bluetooth connectivity for mobile alerts
Compact and wearable design
